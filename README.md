# ELTeC-slv

This is the project for Slovenian ELTeC novels.

The originals come from the IMP digital library and corpus, and the Orig directory contains the uploaded files together with scripts to fetch them from the CLARIN.SI repository and transform them to ELTeC encoding.

The Orig/IMP directory contains both the TEI "digital library" files, i.e. those with running texts, and the "corpus" files, i.e. those that have been automatically tokenised, the words modernised, and these PoS tagged and lemmatised. For Level 1, the digital library files have been used.
