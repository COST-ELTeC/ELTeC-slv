# ELTeC-slv
Folder for richer TEI Encoding with linguistic annotation.

Tokenisation and sentence segmentation performed with [ReLDI tokeniser](https://github.com/clarinsi/reldi-tokeniser) while UD morphosyntactic tagging and lemmatisation with [CLASSLA-StanfordNLP](https://github.com/clarinsi/classla-stanfordnlp) trained for Slovene.

Currently, no normalisation was performed, as it needs some study which novels should be modernised.
