# ELTeC-slv
Folder for richer TEI Encoding with linguistic annotation.

Tokenisation and sentence segmentation performed with [ReLDI tokeniser](https://github.com/clarinsi/reldi-tokeniser), UD morphosyntactic tagging and lemmatisation with [CLASSLA-StanfordNLP](https://github.com/clarinsi/classla-stanfordnlp) trained for Slovene, and named entity tagging with [Janes-NER](https://github.com/clarinsi/janes-ner), which uses the set of NE labels detailed in the [Annotation guidelines for Slovenian named entities Janes-NER V1.1](http://nl.ijs.si/janes/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/SlovenianNER-eng-v1.1.pdf).

Currently, no normalisation was performed, as it needs some study which novels should be modernised.
